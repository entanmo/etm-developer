## ——En-Tan-Mo Side Chain:removing barriers to resource

<img src="/images/skill/guide05_en.jpg" >

Developers are the beneficiaries and facilitator of blockchain technology. A sustainable token ecosystem cannot be built without the effort of dedicated developers. However, we have recently seen the bleeding of DApp builders frommainstream currencies such as ETH and EOS as a result of increasingly costly development and operation, and this has pushed their entire app ecosystem into a vicious cycle. To prevent such situation from happening, En-Tan-Mo embeds the idea of win-win cooperation throughout its mechanism design from the very beginning. En-Tan-Mo’s side chain enables developers to allocate and mobilize on-chain resources on a dynamic basis while the network only charges a small amount of transaction fees for security concerns. And these fees will be re-distributed back to developers through community activities.

## Blockchain Scalability

Scalability is a major bottleneck to development that no blockchain project can afford to ignore. Traditional blockchains, such as Bitcoin, lacks the ability to scale for they demand miners’ full knowledge of the whole blockchain in a bid to ensure the network’s security. The scalability issue limits developer’s creativity and hinders DApp from becoming mainstream application.

Traditionally, Bitcoin and Ethereum rely on a single chain to process and store the data and transactions of the whole network and require every node to keep a copy of the entire history. As such, the processing capacity of the blockchain as a whole is in fact limited by that of a individual node. Plus, due to their consensus algorithm, the system’s overall processing speed tends to decrease rather than increase with the increase of nodes. With a view to improve scalability, several solutions have come forward. The key idea is to let insignificant data and transactions be verified and stored only by partial nodes. Sharding, the proposal of Ethereum, divides the network into 100 different shards and allows them to process transactions independently. En-Tan-Mo, however, approaches it differently. For every DApp there will be an exclusive side chain on which it runs and stores data. This multichain structure lifts the cap on network’s processing capacity, enabling it to handle concurrent transactions in an efficient manner.

Scalability can be enhanced either by shards or by side chains. Yet the former is fixed while the latter enjoys more flexibility. Besides sharding adds to the difficulty of management, because it needs more validators to keep the network safe. Side chain, in contrast, shares the same validation mechanism with the main chain and doesn’t require additional nodes to do the job. When it comes to affordability, sharding is more expensive than side chain protocol. The former uses the costly smart contract. The latter is much more developer-friendly as it streamlines operation, debugging and maintenance procedures via the building ofapplication-specific server.

## Bottleneck to the Development of Ethereum and EOS: limited resource vs. unlimited applications

Is scalability really the only bottleneck to blockchain adoption?

For DApp builders on Ethereum, better user experience means more gas. But cost is not the only problem they are worrying about. The complexity of DApp hinges on the number of Ethereum stacks. That is, building a slightly sophisticated DApp is basically out of the question. As such, simply boosting scalability will do very little to improve Ethereum’s ability to attract developers and encourage extensive adoption, given that the network’s core ideas remain the same. In addition, Ethereum is heading towards an uncertain future, as it plans to migrate from PoW to PoS, which even raises mores concern among DApp users and developers.

To shorten the time of confirmation, EOS shifts away from Proof-of-Work and charges a handful of supernodes with the responsibility to verify and pack transactions for the whole network. Claiming to be able to scale to millions transactions per second, EOS does considerably well, achieving thousands under real test conditions. Therefore, the true impediment to EOS development is not scalability but something else. In our view, it is RAM.

There exists a memory market on EOS where contract developers write information into a block and perform operations by consuming RAM. RAM is an tradable resource that is used in many operations, say creating an account and biding for an account name. According to EOS’s algorithm, RAM price fluctuates based on demand. The more RAM one uses, the higher the price goes until it reaches a point where RAM becomes so expensive that no one can afford and that’s how EOS makes sure the platform will never run out of it. The volatility in RAM price breeds speculation. Most of the RAM is held by speculators while DApp developers are starved of this very resources they need to launch their product. Even if they do get it, the cost would be too expensive. Should there be a proper mechanism to keep RAM market in order, developers would turn to other platform with developer-friendly environment before long. This is bound to undermine EOS, both in terms of its DApp ecosystem and its value as an application platform.

Taking a closer look at the way EOS works, we will find that RAM is far from being the only impediment to the platform’s development and adoption. For every task performed, four resources, namely EOS, RAM, CPU and NET, are required. This is beyond doubt a catastrophe for users and developers.

The question we should ask is, when necessity becomes rarity, is there any possibility of mainstream adoption for blockchain?

## Side Chain: No more cut-throat competition. It’s time for win-win cooperation

A brief review of current blockchain projects shows that the development of the whole blockchain ecosystem is seriously hindered by the scarcity of resources and the vicious competition between DApps and developers. That’s also the reason why there has not so far been any blockchain-based DApp that gains mainstream adoption. En-Tan-Mo, powered by the main chainside chain structure, removes barriers to resources, with each DApp running independently on an exclusive side chain with full functionality. En-TanMo’s Unified-Proof-of-Stake (UPoS) algorithm is able to manage 500 transactions per second and reduces the average block intervals to 3 seconds. With independent side chains, En-TanMo enjoys infinite potential to scale. As side chain increases, the network will be able to do N*1000 transactions per second, carrying DApps with better user experience, such as game. In short, on En-Tan-Mo, scalability will not stand in the way of developers’ imagination becoming reality. Backed by powerful technical infrastructure, En-Tan-Mo lays the foundation for the new generation of internet application platform and paves the way for future technical innovation and reform.

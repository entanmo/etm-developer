## Get your apps ready for the new world

For app builders, the value of blockchain goes beyond the benefits of deploying a novel technology. It brings a change of mindset and an equitable platform for app development.

Today’s app market is riddled with bad business practices. Technology behemoths monopolize profits. App transparency is lacking. Abuse of user permission runs rampant while personal data is sold and leveraged. However, things could change with blockchain-powered DApp, which enables users to make transactions in a safer, transparent and efficient manner, and opens up possibilities for new way of life in the internet age : taking your privacy back from the internet giants. Being transparent, open, reliable and decentralized, DApp addresses the major deficiencies of traditional apps, and is bound to give rise to a brand new business ecosystem.

A great technology should benefit all rather than some. However, this would be impossible without the hard work of developers. For this reason, En-Tan-Mo is committed to putting in place a sound and high-performance platform for app development; a platform that runs an open, thriving developer’s community and selfevolving blockchain application components; and a platform that shatters the walls between finance, energy, business and people’s daily lives and encourages free flows of value.

## En-Tan-Mo enables developers to write and deploy Dapp easily.

### Main Chain-Side Chain Mechanism

Each DApp runs on an exclusive side chainwith full functionality so that it is independent fromone another. DApp builders can take technologiesfrom main chain and directly implement themon side chain, and customize token, transactiontype, consensus, block parameter and other sidechain parameters according to their needs. Thishelps to inject flexibility and diversity into DAppdevelopment.

### Node.js

JavaScript is enabled in En-Tan-Mo. As oneof the most commonly used scripting language,JavaScript support a great variety of third-partycomponents and thus holds appeal to extensivedevelopers and communities. As such En-Tan-Mo makes it prossible for developers, both asindividuals and as aggregates, to get started rightaway and substantially reduces their workload.

### High-performance

While ensuring security and decentralization,En-Tan-Mo’s Unified-Proof-of-Stake (UPoS)algorithm greatly enhances the performance ofmain chain with TPS reaching 1000/s and the timeneeded to produce a new block being shortenedto 3 seconds. Since side chains are independentfrom each other, En-Tan-Mo enjoys infinite potentialto scale. With the increase of DApps, the networkwill be able to allow N*1000 transactions persecond. Therefore, it is capable of running DAppsthat demand better user experience, such asgame. In short, under Unified-Proof-of-Stake (UPoS),developers can give free rein to their imaginationwithout worrying about scalability.

### Modular Framework

The adoption of the main chain-side chain mechanism and Node.js makes DApp building on En-Tan-Mo easier and more flexible. Moreover, the well-developed SKD and API further lower the cost of development. Such a modular framework allows developers to focus only on their products and directly benefit from main chain and side chain upgrades without making adjustment accordingly.

### Zero Development Cost

Mainstream currencies such as ETH and EOSrecently suffered from a loss of DApp builders as a result of unaffordable development and operation cost, and this has pushed their entire app ecosystem into a vicious cycle. En-Tan-Mo is aware that a prosperous app ecosystem and active development community are the most valuable assets and the very force driving the platform’s sustainable development. Therefore, the idea of win-win cooperation is embedded in its mechanism design from the very beginning so as to prevent such situation from happening. En-TanMo’s side chain enables developers to allocate and mobilize on-chain resources on a dynamic basis while the network only charges a small amount of transaction fees for security concerns. And these fees will be re-distributed back to developers through community activities.

### Secure and Reliable

En-Tan-Mo’s Unified-Proof-of-Stake (UPoS) algorithm is a Nash equilibrium-based consensus mechanism that combines the merits of both Proofof-Work and Delegated-Proof-of-Stake. Thus it delivers better security and efficiency as opposed to the computationally-intensive Proof-of-Work algorithm. En-Tan-Mo also introduces the chaotic shuffling mechanism as an effective way to guard against Sybil attack and coordinated attack, further improving the network’s security. Moreover, development on any side chain won’t undermine main chain and other side chains.

### Scalability

A sound distributed system should enjoy good ability to scale. On En-Tan-Mo, developers can easily deploy applications, increase the size of nodes and allocate them according to the need of DApp.

### Open-source

En-Tan-Mo is an open-source, transparent and secure network under the MIT license and our code can be checked on GitHub. In this way we encourage everyone to be part of the En-Tan-Mo community and contribute to its development.

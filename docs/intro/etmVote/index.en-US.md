Each year will see a steady decrease in the amount of ETM distributed for this purpose. Of the total voting bonus, 1/4 will be shared among all the voters in proportion to their respective votes. 1/4 will first be equally divided among the respective voters of the elected 101 block producers and then be given to each voter in proportion to his/her votes. 1/2 will be created to one of the voters of elected block producers.

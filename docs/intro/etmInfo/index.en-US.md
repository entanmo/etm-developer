En-Tan-Mo is a next-generation blockchain based on Nash equilibrium and the idea of value transfer. Its name emerged from Entente, Transaction and Mobius.
The core En-Tan-Mo team includes Prof. Thomas Sargent, leader of the rational expectation revolution and winner of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Economics, Professor Sheldon Lee Glashow, the Nobel Prize-winning theoretical physicist who proposed the Grand Unified Theory; as well as scholars from Califor- nia Institute of Technology, the University of Maryland and the institut Henri Poincare who realized SHD completeness by innovatively incorporating game theory in blockchain develop- ment.
En-Tan-Mo is a blockchain operating system with the capacity to carry hundreds of millions of users, a coalition mining pool that provides distributed services, and a high-frequency high-traffic exchange for digital token. It is not only an open developers' community and a self-evolving blockchain-based platform, but also an ecosystem that connects finance, energy, business and people's lives and a next-generation internet platform for value trans-fer.

# Join ETM To Become A Miner

As the most stable form of money, gold once made its miners the most attractive profession and provided the world with a steady flow of fortune. In the world of blockchain, however, there exist a different kind of "miners" who mine another source of value—cryptocurrencies.

## What Is Blockchain Miner?

Instead of toiling with picks and shovels, blockchain miners mine digital currency by means of high-end technologies.

The job of blockchain miner is to keep a ledger, or more specifically, to validate transactions and pack data. Anyone with a computing device can become a miner. All he/she has to do is download a mining software and let the programme get to work.

## Why En-Tan-Mo?

The cost of mining is quite similar with that of autonomous driving. It is not about the time of time spent mining (driving) but how expensive is the gear (car) and how much electricity is consumed in the process.

En-Tan-Mo meets the abovementioned two conditions for low-cost mining, allowing users to mine on multiple blockchains simultaneously and getting payoffs at a negligible expense.

How?

Litecoin and Dogecoin are two typical blockchains that allow users to simultaneously mine more than one cryptocurrencies, with the same electricity and gear as mining only one.

let's move back to mining on En-Tan-Mo. As for En-Tan-Mo-based mining, specialized mining machine is not necessary. A middle-end graphics card is enough to do the job. Thus the cost is significantly lower than other blockchain mining that requires antminer more than 10，000 yuan's worth.

What's more, no electricity is wasted and gear worn during the multi-currency mining, or we can say such loss is next to zero. Users can mine on two cryptocurrencies at the same time without interference.

With respect to electricity input, multi-currency mining will neither lead to an increase in consumption nor in cost, for there is negligible electricity loss in the process.

Currently if we mine Ethereum with six RX570 cards at a hashrate of roughly 60 Mhash/s, the payoff is 0.0138096 ETH , equivalent to 15.19 RMB, per day. (1ETH=1100RMB)

The payoff of En-Tan-Mo mining is much higher. As we know, there are approximately 28000 new blocks being chained to En-Tan-Mo every day. Suppose a miner is elected in every round of production and generates 280 blocks in total, then he/she will be able to get 840 ETMs or 840 RMB as return (1 ETM=1RMB). Even if the miner in question only gets elected once out of every ten rounds, he/she will also obtain 84 RMB in reward.


| Crypto-currency | Mining Rig | Hashrate | Mining Reward | Reward in Cash |
|------|----------|-----------|---------------|--------------------------|
|ETH   | RX570 card|160 Mhash/s|0.0138096ETH/day|15.19RMB/day（1ETH=1100RMB）|
|ETM   | Multi-currency<br>mining without mining machine|15 Mhash/s<br>occupies 0.5sec/min|840ETM/day (ideal condition)<br>84ETM/day (if the miner is elected once out of ten rounds)|84RMB/day（1ETM=1RMB）|


As such it is fair to say that En-Tan-Mo mining enables users to profit handsomely at negligible cost.

## How to Be An En-Tan-Mo Miner?

To become an En-Tan-Mo miner, all you need is a wallet address and a mining rig to receive reward and get started.

First you need to register a En-Tan-Mo Wallet through our official website https://wallet.entanmo.com/. Please make sure that your password and wallet address are well-kept.

Then add the En-Tan-Mo mining program to your existing mining rig or high-end graphics card and become an En-Tan-Mo node. You can create the multi-currency mining mode by entering your user name and wallet address. After all the aforementioned steps are completed, restart your gear and the multiple-currency mining mode will start running automatically.

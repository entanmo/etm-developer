# Join ETM To Become A DApp Developer

## What is DApp?

The main difference between App and blockchain-based DApp is whether or not the application is decentralized. That DApp stores data in a distributed manner makes it decentralized by nature.

As a unique kind of internet application program, DApp runs on decentralized network, also known as blockchain. Unlike traditional App, It is not controlled by a central server and nor does it rely on the server to process and access data.

A true DApp is completely open-sourced and autonomous. Most of Apps cannot do the former, let alone the latter. As we see so often that once an App is installed, users are compelled to agree with its terms.

In contrast, DApp is irreversible once deployed. Systematic updates will not take place unless the majority of users reach consensus. In addition, all the DApp data must be encrypted and stored on decentralized blockchain platform.

Besides, a token system is crucial to the effective operation of DApp.


## Why Is En-Tan-Mo An Ideal Platform for DApp Development?

A sound operating platform is essential to good DApp development.

Both Ethereum and EOS have come under heavy criticism for their failure of delivering an developer-friendly environment. On the one hand, the poor scalability makes it impossible for Ethereum to swiftly handle transactions in large numbers. On the other, EOS is weighed down by serious traffic congestion as a result of limited memory.

To root out the problems of Ethereum and EOS, En-Tan-Mo develops a unique multichain structure consist of a single main chain and multiple side chains, creating an enabling environment for DApp development.

According to our design, each DApp corresponds to an independent, exclusive and full-fledged side chain so that it does not have to share the limited resources with others while enjoying the benefits of blockchain technology. In this way we enhance DApp's ability to scale by a large margin.

Moreover, developers are able to not only use the same powerful technology as the main chain, but also customize side chain parameters, such as token, transaction, consensus and block, according to their demands.

By shortening the block intervals to 3 seconds, En-Tan-Mo's UPoS consensus drastically increases performance without affecting security and functionality. Under such consensus, it is estimated that the increase of DApps and corresponding side chains will allow En-Tan-Mo to scale to N*1000 TPS in the future.

On En-Tan-Mo developers are able to effectively run a variety of DApps, even games that demand better user experience. With the multichain structure in place, scalability will no longer be the bottleneck to the realization of developer's imagination.

As such we En-Tan-Mo enable DApp development to be more flexible and diverse.

## How to Become A Developer on En-Tan-Mo?

Both App and Dapp need a clear, viable and profitable idea before the development begins.

Once developer come with a valuable idea, he/she has to master a certain developing skills and use relevant developing tools to further his/her work.

In the case of En-Tan-Mo, the developing tools or software a developer needs is En-Tan-Mo Components, including En-Tan-Mo main chain, side chains, etm-cli and wallet.

Currently En-Tan-Mo supports Centos 7, Ubuntu 16.04（Ubuntu 16.10 is preferred）and Ubuntu 18.04. MacOS is not available for the moment.

When it comes to contract development, developers need to write, test and activate contract. Before you write contract, please make sure that main chain is put into operation and starts production. Prior to the release of contract, developers can run development on test net. DApp registration is indispensable for the activation of contract. There are independent trustees for each DApp, all of whom are bookkeepers. They are responsible for the block production and interchain asset transfer and charge fees for their work.

Front-end interface is also an important part of the development. It includes development on account, block, transaction, trustee, node and lock-up.
